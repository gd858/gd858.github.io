       - **Sentiment:** Neutral to Positive

3. **Author:** Avendork
   - **Content:** "Ollama doesn't say anything about compatibility with Intel GPUs, only Nvidia with CUDA and AMD with RocM. So my guess is no. That said I hope it can be supported. Even better if there is a 16gb variant at some point."
