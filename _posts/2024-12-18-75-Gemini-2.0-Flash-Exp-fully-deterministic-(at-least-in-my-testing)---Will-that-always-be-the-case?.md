## 2. Summary of the Post:
The original post discusses the issue of non-deterministic outputs in language models (LLMs), particularly Gemini 1.5 and the newly tested Gemini 2.0 Flash. The author expresses frustration with inconsistent results, even under conditions that should yield determinism (temperature set to 0, specific seed). The post highlights successful tests conducted with Gemini 2.0 Flash that yielded consistent results, and poses questions regarding whether this determinism is a permanent feature, potential causes for differences in behavior between model versions, and comparisons to other models.

## 3. Key Themes and Topics:
- **Determinism in LLMs:** Challenges of achieving consistent outputs.
- **Model Comparisons:** Differences between Gemini 1.5 and Gemini 2.0 Flash.
- **Testing Methodology:** Suggestion to test smaller open-sourced models for determinism.
- **Impacts of Model Hosting:** Concerns about model behavior influenced by external factors when hosted.

## 4. Sentiment Analysis:
- **Overall Sentiment:** Positive tone, particularly regarding the deterministic nature of Gemini 2.0 Flash.
- **Discussion Tone:** Generally technical and inquisitive, focusing on improvements in model performance.
- **Shift in Sentiment:** No major shifts noted, but cautious optimism regarding the advancements in the new model.
