   - **Replies:**
     - **Author:** ekcrisp
       - **Content:** Interesting suggestion, worth trying. My use case is fairly broad and to basically make the model more conversational and fun/entertaining. I'm guessing the domain would need to be more specific to get decent performance parity between 1B and 3B.

       - **Sentiment:** Neutral
     - **Author:** davernow
       - **Content:** Most likely but worth a shot. Worst case you use the dataset to fine tune the 3B and help the quality there.

       - **Sentiment:** Positive

3. **Author:** Puzzled-Air1539
   - **Content:** If part of the reason your generation is slow is due to the fact that your system prompt is so large, one thing you can do is create a synthetic dataset of model responses with that system prompt, and during fine-tuning, replace it with something much smaller.
