1. **Comment by *jlreyes***
   - **Content:** "This is a pretty tough problem to get right. I remember when ChatGPT search first launched it just used bing and was terrible and slow. Perplexity does their own web crawling and indexing and they are optimizing for the LLM use case, that's pretty different than just using have an LLM use a Search API. I suspect ChatGPT started to do the same and that's why it is better now."
