2. **Author:** phree_radical
   - **Content:** All you need are a few examples.  If the examples are so short, it's a perfect opportunity to try few-shot instead of instructions.  Simply write a few (three to eight, probably) ideal examples and let the LLM complete the one at the end.  You'll be surprised how much more capable LLMs are without instruction fine-tuning ⏤
