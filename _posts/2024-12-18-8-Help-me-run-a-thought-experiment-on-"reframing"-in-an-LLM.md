## 2. Summary of the Post:
The original post discusses a thought experiment related to token selection in language models (LLMs) and introduces a mechanism for "reframing." The author proposes a method where current context can be stored and referenced (denoted as a bookmark), influencing subsequent token choices either by encouraging or discouraging certain outputs based on their similarity to the stored context. The aim is to explore how this could function like a short-term memory mechanism that does not increase the context size.

## 3. Key Themes and Topics:
- Token Selection in LLMs
- Concept of "Reframing"
- Suggestions for Memory and Goal Incorporation
- Potential Mechanism of Embeddings
- Contrast between Correct and Incorrect Outputs
- CFG Sampling as a Related Concept
