       - **Content:** Yeah. People used to complain about Mistral licensing, but that's actually very easy to evaluate and test for production use. This license in comparison is a complete show-stopper. I won't even be bringing it up at work let alone using it.

       - **Content:** Isn’t it a “merge” with extra steps? Their model can’t be distributed with the Apache 2.0 license, or more like it can, but you’ll have to also respect the licenses of all 6 mentioned LLMs.
