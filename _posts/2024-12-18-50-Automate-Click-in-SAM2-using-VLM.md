## 2. Summary of the Post:
The author is seeking assistance to automate the process of clicking on specific objects in SAM 2 for tracking purposes. They aim to utilize Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like Groundingdino or Florence2 to facilitate this automation. However, the author expresses concern that the classes they wish to track (mainly construction-related items) may not be recognized by these models due to a lack of pretraining. They also consider using other models (InternVl2.5 or QwenVl2) but note their inaccuracy in providing object coordinates. The author solicits advice from the community on how best to proceed, mentioning their inexperience with VLMs and LLMs.
