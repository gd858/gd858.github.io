### Top-Level Comments:

1. **Author:** Calcidiol  
   **Content:** Thanks for making this, it is very interesting to track these kinds of devices. Eventually the ones that do not already have NPU/TPU or some kind of ML acceleration will get better capacity for that and there will be dozens of different interesting edge choices with widely varying capabilities of model type / SW engine / performance / energy use.
